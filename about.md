title: About
---

I'm an IT student with a strong interest in **cybersecurity**, **Linux systems**, and
hands-on problem solving.

I enjoy breaking down complex systems, understanding how they work under the hood,
and documenting what I learn through projects and technical writeups.

My focus areas include:
- Linux and Windows internals
- Network security
- CTFs and security labs
- Scripting and automation

This website serves as a living portfolio of my work and learning process.
